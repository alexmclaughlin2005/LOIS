## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Always reference design specs** when building UI components
2. **Use design tokens** from DESIGN_SPECIFICATIONS.md (don't hardcode colors)
3. **Follow 8px spacing grid** for consistent layouts
4. **Check PROJECT_PLAN.md** weekly to stay on track
5. **Update README.md** as you make setup changes
6. **Document decisions** in dedicated files (e.g., TECH_STACK.md)
7. **Test with synthetic data** that matches legal case management context

## üö® Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Design Fidelity**: Match Figma designs precisely - this is critical for user testing
‚ö†Ô∏è **Performance**: All searches must complete < 1 second
‚ö†Ô∏è **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG 2.1 AA standards
‚ö†Ô∏è **Data Context**: Legal case management focus (personal injury, discovery, etc.)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Dual Interface**: Support both AI chat and traditional feed views
