## Key Findings from Design Analysis

### 1. Dual Interface Paradigm
LOIS combines **two distinct UI approaches**:

#### A. Conversational AI Interface
- Chat-centric with LOIS sidebar
- "Ask LOIS" as primary interaction
- Saved routines and prompts
- Natural language input with voice/upload
- Action cards: Search, Report, Analyze, Summarize

#### B. FileVine-Style Activity Feed
- Traditional case management interface
- Activity feed with tasks, notes, messages
- Advanced filtering (Unread, Messages, Tasks)
- Status tracking (Overdue, Complete)
- Project/case organization

**Integration**: Seamless transition between AI chat and structured views via "Ask LOIS" button throughout.

### 2. Visual Design System
- **Brand Color**: Coral/pink (#FF6B6B)
- **Primary CTA**: Black buttons
- **Backgrounds**: Light gray (#F7F7F6), White (#FFFFFF)
- **Typography**: Helvetica Now Display (headings), System fonts (body)
- **Spacing**: 8px grid system
- **Components**: Designed for consistency and accessibility

### 3. Data Context
Design reveals legal/case management focus:
- Personal injury cases
- Discovery phases
- Depositions scheduling
- Medical records tracking
- Client communication logs
- Attorney/paralegal assignments

3. Validate data structure
4. Test database insertion
5. Expand to other entity types

## Outstanding Questions

These questions should be clarified before or during early development:

### Product Questions
1. Is LOIS a standalone application or a FileVine plugin/integration?
2. What are the top 3 most important use cases to demonstrate?
3. Who are the primary user personas (attorneys, paralegals, admins)?
4. What is the expected query complexity?

### Technical Questions
1. Should conversations persist across sessions?
2. Do we need real-time updates (WebSockets)?
3. What level of offline support is needed?
4. What export formats are most important (PDF, CSV, Excel)?

### Design Questions
1. Are there any design elements we missed?
2. Are mobile mockups available?
3. What's the primary screen size to optimize for?
4. Any animation/transition specifications?

### Integration Questions
1. Are there APIs to existing systems we need to integrate with?
2. Authentication/authorization requirements?
3. Data privacy or compliance requirements (HIPAA, etc.)?

**Recommendation**: Schedule a kickoff meeting to address these questions.
